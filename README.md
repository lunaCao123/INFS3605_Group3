Welcome to CrisisNews - an application with the purpose of educating business owners on crisis-related guidelines, and allowing for industry leaders to better communicate with their industry. 

A login is not required to read the posts or submit a question, but it is required to write posts, delete posts and respond to questions. Use the login details below:

Username: admin
Password: admin123

Further development on our app will likely be based around:
- A “sign up” page for industry leaders to register their interest in becoming a content contributor
- Transforming the FAQ page into a discussion forum
- Making an “Edit Post” function so that posts can be edited, and not need to be fully deleted and re-uploaded if changes occur
- A “subscribe” function that allows users to be notified via email or mobile when certain crisis posts are made
- Expansion of the application’s reach to all of Australia, not just NSW

If the file fails to build, please click Build —> Clean Project. This is an issue we are still working on resolving.
